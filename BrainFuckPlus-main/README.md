# BrainFuck++

BrainFuck++ is a humorous take on the C++ programming language, designed to add more fun and excitement to the world of esoteric programming languages. It combines the simplicity and quirkiness of Brainfuck with the syntax and features of C++.

## Features

- Familiar syntax: BrainFuck++ retains the core syntax and commands of the original Brainfuck language, making it easy for enthusiasts to get started.
- C++ inspired: BrainFuck++ incorporates elements of C++ syntax and concepts, allowing programmers to write code with a touch of familiarity and humor.
- Extended functionality: BrainFuck++ introduces additional commands and features, expanding the capabilities of the language beyond traditional Brainfuck.
- Interoperability: BrainFuck++ code can interact with C++ code, enabling developers to combine the power of both languages.

## Getting Started

To run BrainFuck++ code, you will need a BrainFuck++ interpreter or compiler. You can find a suitable implementation at:

- [BrainFuck++ Interpreter](https://github.com/interpreter-link)
- [BrainFuck++ Compiler](https://github.com/compiler-link)

Once you have set up the interpreter or compiler, follow these steps to run your BrainFuck++ code:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/brainfuck-plus-plus.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd brainfuck-plus-plus`
3. Write your BrainFuck++ code in a file with the `.bfpp` extension.
4. Execute the code using the interpreter or compiler: `bfpp run your-code.bfpp`

## Examples

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in BrainFuck++:
